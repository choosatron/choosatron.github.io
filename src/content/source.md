### Version control

We use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for version control, and [Github](http://www.github.com) as our central repository for all of our source code. Anyone can view our open source repositories, and with a free Github account, raise issues and contribute to our source code.

### Feature requests and bug fixes

We use [Github Issues](https://github.com/features) to track issues for each of our open source repositories, and [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/) to share our workflow.

Each of the above repositories has a link for issues and a waffle workflow board; feel free to submit feature requests and raise bugs on Github, or star a repository to follow its progress.

### Contributions

We welcome contributions to all of our open source repositories. These contributions come in the form of a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests), where you "fork" our repositories and then request that we "pull" your changes back into our repositories. You must have a Github account to make a contribution.

All contributors must first sign the [Monkey with a Mustache Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/choosatron/open-source/blob/master/sign-cla.md), which is based on the Google CLA, and provides Monkey with a Mustache, LLC and the Choosatron team a license to re-distribute your contributions.

Whenever possible, please follow these guidelines for contributions:
